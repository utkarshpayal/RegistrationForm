## Introduction

The Java Registration Form is designed to capture user data and store it in a MySQL database. It also sends a confirmation email to the user's provided email address. The code uses Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and JDBC for database connectivity.

## Features

- User-friendly registration form with fields for name, gender, father's name, password, city, and email.
- Database storage: User data is stored in a MySQL database.
- Password validation: The form checks whether the entered password matches the confirmation password.
- Email confirmation: A confirmation email is sent to the user's provided email address.
- Reset button: Users can clear the form fields using the reset button.

## Requirements

To run the Java Registration Form, you will need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- MySQL Database
- Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
- MySQL Connector/J library for JDBC

Make sure to set up your MySQL database with a table named "student" to store user data. The table should have columns for name, gender, fatherName, password, city, and email.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the source code to your local machine.

2. Open the code in your Java IDE.

3. Make sure you have set up a MySQL database and configured it with the appropriate table and columns.

4. Update the database connection details in the code:
   - Replace `"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database"` with your database URL.
   - Replace `"username"` with your MySQL username.
   - Replace `"password"` with your MySQL password.

5. Build and run the Java program.

6. The registration form will appear, allowing users to enter their information.

7. Click the "REGISTER" button to store user data in the database and send a confirmation email.

8. Use the "RESET" button to clear the form fields.

## Email Configuration

To send confirmation emails, the code uses JavaMail with Gmail as the email service provider. To configure the email functionality, make sure to do the following:

1. Replace `"your_email"` with your Gmail email address.
2. Replace `"your_password"` with your Gmail password.

Please note that using your Gmail credentials in code is not recommended for production use. For production applications, consider using a more secure method for sending emails, such as environment variables.
